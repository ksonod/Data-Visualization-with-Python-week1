# Data-Visualization-with-Python-week1
This repository is based on the first week's exercise of the Coursera course "Data Visualization with Python." The code "Immigration.py" allows you
1. to get the data of the number of immigrants to Canada,
2. to modify the data in an appropreate way, 
and
3. to show a graph that represents the numbers of immigrants for top 5 countries.
